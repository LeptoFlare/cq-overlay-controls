# C.Q. Overlay Controls
- Replicants are solely used as a way to transfer data to `graphics`
- Here is a model of where data is stored:
  - User to Dashboard - `state`
  - Dashboard to Graphics - `replicant`
- Each dashboard panel only has one replicant.
  - Names should follow this format:
    - `currentFoobar.json`
    - `foobar.html`
    - `foobar.tsx`
- This replicant must be defined in `schemas`
